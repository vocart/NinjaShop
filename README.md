NinjaShop is an excercise in Django from Antoni Mele's book 'Django2. Praktyczne tworzenie aplikacji sieciowych. Wydanie II'.

It consists of a shop's site with some Japan related items to choose from. They can be added to a 'basket' and the buyer can make an 'order'. 
There is also an administration site where can be added more objects.
